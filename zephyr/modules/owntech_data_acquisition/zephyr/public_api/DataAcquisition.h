	 * This functions starts the acquisition chain. It must be called

	 * configuration change is allowed after module has been started.
	 * If you're not sure how to initialize ADC, just use the Hardware
	 * Configuration module API: hwConfig.configureAdcDefaultAllMeasurements()
	 *
	 * NOTE 1: If your code uses an uninterruptible task, you do not need to start
	 * Data Acquisition manually, it will automatically be started at the same
	 * time as the task as their internal behavior are intrinsically linked.
	 *
	 * NOTE 2: Data Acquisition must be started before accessing any
	 * dataAcquisition.get*() or dataAcquisition.peek*() function.
	 * Other Data Acquisition functions are safe to use before starting
	 * the module.
	 *
	 * @param dispatch_method Indicates when the dispatch should be done.
	 *        Dispatch makes data from ADCs available to dataAcquisition.get*()
	 *        functions, thus available to the user.
	 *        You should not worry too much about this parameter, as if you
	 *        call this function manually, the default value is what you want,
	 *        so just call the function without any parameter.
	 *        By default, Data Acquisition is started automatically when
	 *        the uninterruptible task is started, with dispatch method
	 *        set to at_uninterruptible_task_start. However, if you do not
	 *        use an uninterrptible task in your application, default parameter
	 *        on_dma_interrupt is the correct value.
	 *        If for some reason you have an uninterruptible task in your code,
	 *        but stoill want the dispatch to be done on DMA interrupt,
	 *        you need to call this function prior to starting the task.
	 *        Note that using DMA interrupts will consume a non-negligible
	 *        amount of processor time and it is not advised.
	 *
	 * @return 0 if everything went well, -1 if there was an error.
	 *         Error is triggered when dispatch method is set to
	 *         uninterruptible task start, but the task has not been
	 *         defined yet.

	/**
	 * Functions to access the acquired data for each channel.
	 * Each function provides a buffer in which all data that
	 * have been acquired since last call are stored. The count
	 * of these values is returned as an output parameter: the
	 * user has to define a variable and pass a reference to this
	 * variable as the parameter of the function. The variable
	 * will be updated with the number of values that are available
	 * in the buffer.
	 *
	 * NOTE 1: When calling one of these functions, it invalidates
	 *         the buffer returned by a previous call to the same function.
	 * NOTE 2: All function buffers are independent from each other.
	 * NOTE 3: When using these functions, the user is responsible for data
	 *         conversion. Use dataAcquisition.convert*() functions for this
	 *         purpose.
	 * NOTE 4: When using these functions for a channel, DO NOT use the
	 *         functions to get the latest converted value for the same channel
	 *         as these functions clear the buffer and disregard all values
	 *         but the latest.
	 *
	 * @param  number_of_values_acquired Pass an uint32_t variable.
	 *         This variable will be updated with the number of values that
	 *         have been acquired for this channel.
	 * @return Pointer to a buffer in which the acquired values are stored.
	 *         If number_of_values_acquired is 0, do not try to access the
	 *         buffer as it may be NULL.
