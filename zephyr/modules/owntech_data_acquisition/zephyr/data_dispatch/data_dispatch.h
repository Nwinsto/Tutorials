 * @brief Data dispatch is intended at dispatching ADCs
 * acquired data from DMA buffers to per-channel buffers.
 * User can then request the data of a specific channel.
 *
 * It uses double-buffering, holding 2 buffers for each
 * enabled channel of each ADC, one being filled and one
 * made available to the user.
